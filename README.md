## Course Description


This course offers a comprehensive exploration of foundational principles in Deep Learning. It begins with a focus on basic concepts, starting from single-layer neural networks, gradually progressing through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Faster R-CNNs, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Continuing forward, it delves into advanced architectures such as Transformers, and culminates with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Table of Contents

Please find below a brief overview of the contents of this repository:
1. `HW1/`: This directory comprises implementations of simple perceptron and Adaline networks for the Iris dataset. Additionally, it includes the implementation of a paper on autoencoders and knowledge distillation applied to the MNIST dataset.
2. `HW2/`: This directory contains code and answers for Assignment 2, which focused on conditional probability, binomial probability, geometric random variables, Poisson random variables, and using ggplot2 for data visualization.
3. `HW3/`: This directory contains code and answers for Assignment 3, which focuses on Hypothesis testing, Confidence Intervals, error types I and II, calculating power, and calculating confidence intervals for the Galton dataset.
4. `HW4/`: This directory contains code and answers for Assignment 4, which focuses on ANOVA, t-distribution, comparing two means, Multiple Comparisons, and Bootstrapping.
5. `HW5/`: This directory contains code and answers for Assignment 5, which focuses on  Inference for Proportion, Independence Tests(chi-square test), and Inference for Proportion.
6. `HW6/`: This directory contains code and answers for Assignment 6, which focuses on regression and goodness of fit.
7. `Final Project/`: Here, you can find code related to the projects completed as part of the course requirements.
