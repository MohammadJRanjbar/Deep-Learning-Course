## Course Description


This course offers a comprehensive exploration of foundational principles in Deep Learning. It begins with a focus on basic concepts, starting from single-layer neural networks, gradually progressing through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Faster R-CNNs, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Continuing forward, it delves into advanced architectures such as Transformers and culminates with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
